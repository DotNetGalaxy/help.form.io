Once you have configured your Form.io project with all the **Forms**, **Resources**, **Actions**, and **Roles & Permissions**, you are now ready to build your Serverless Data Management application. These applications are built as **Single Page Applications** and a lot of documentation exists to help the development community get started with that paradigm of application development. With this paradigm, there have been a number of Frameworks and Libraries that have risen up to enable developers to rapidly build Single page applications. The most popular of these is a framework called [Angular](https://angular.io/) and library called [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

Before you begin building your application, you will need to decide which of these systems you would like to use, and then leverage the Form.io libraries that allow you to embed the forms and resources within your application.

Form.io provides a number of Open Source libraries that interface with Angular, React, as well as plain JavaScript to enable you embed Form.io into your application. All of these libraries are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/formio) at [https://github.com/formio](https://github.com/formio). Each of these libraries provide their own developer documentation on the projects pages within Github. These main libraries used for application development are as follows.
