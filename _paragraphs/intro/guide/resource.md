An Event Management system will need to store some "structured" objects called **Events**. These are called **Resources** in Form.io, so lets create a new **Event** by clicking on the following.

We will then build our **Event** object using a form builder (pretty cool). We could also provide some field validations and such, but for now we will keep the form simple.

When you are done, click on **Create Resource**

### Assigning Permissions
You now need to allow Authenticated users to read all events, but only Admins can manage them. To do this, click on **Access** section, and configure the settings as follows.

Make sure you press **Save Changes** when you are done adding those.
