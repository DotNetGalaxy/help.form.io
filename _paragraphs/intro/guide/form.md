Now that we have an Event resource, we need a way for people to register to attend the Event. This is a great use case for a **Form** which provides "unstructured" data that references Resources.

Let's create a new form by clicking on the **Forms** section and pressing **New Form**. Here we will build an **Event Registration** form like so...

We now need to **Tag** our form so that it is differentiated from the other forms and relates to the events. We do that under **Advanced Settings** and **Form Tags**.

When you are done adding fields and tagging the form, press **Create Form**

### Access Permissions
We also need to ensure that **Authenticated** users can submit the Registration Form, so we will go to the **Access** section.

Make sure you press **Save Settings** at the bottom to save those changes to the form.

We are now done setting up our Form.io Resources + Forms for our application, now lets build an app!
