Form.io also has integration with the amazing [Node Red](http://nodered.org) platform. With this installed within Node Red, you will now have two nodes to pick from.

  - formio save (storage): This will save a new form submission.
  - formio get (storage): This will retrieve a list of submissions based on a query provided in msg.query.
  - formio in (input): This will receive a Form.io form webhook to use forms as input.

To learn more about this, please go to [Form.io Node Red](https://github.com/formio/formio-red) Github page.
