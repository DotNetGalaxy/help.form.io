The Form Builder is an AngularJS directive where you can embed a full functioning Form Builder within your application using a simple directive as follows.

```
<formio-builder form="form"></formio-builder>
```

This produces the following form builder.

The Form builder is really just a glorified JSON schema builder which can then be fed into the Form Renderer as seen in the following codepen.

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="xVyMjo" data-default-tab="result" data-user="travist" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Form.io Form Building and Rendering" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/travist/pen/xVyMjo/">Form.io Form Building and Rendering</a> by Travis Tidwell (<a href="http://codepen.io/travist">@travist</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
