formio bootstrap [GitHub Project]
```

You can bootstrap any Form.io application within GitHub easily with our one line bootstrap command. First find a repository that you wish to bootstrap. Here are a few...

  - https://github.com/formio/formio-app-eventmanager
  - https://github.com/formio/formio-app-todo
  - https://github.com/formio/formio-app-movie
  - https://github.com/formio/formio-app-formio
  - https://github.com/formio/formio-app-salesquote

Example: If you wish to bootstrap the ToDo application, simply type the following in the command line.

```
formio bootstrap formio/formio-app-todo
```

This will download, extract, create, configure and serve your application in one command!
