Give `Formio` a `src` property and render:

```javascript
var React = require('react');
var Formio = require('react-formio');

// React <= 0.13
React.render(
  <Formio src="https://example.formio/example" />
  , document.getElementById('example')
);

// React >= 0.14
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

ReactDOM.render(
  <Formio src="https://example.formio/example" />
  , document.getElementById('example')
);
```

You can also pass in the submission url as the `src` and the form will render with the data populated from the submission.

#### `onFormSubmit` : `(submission: object)`

A function callback that will be called when a submission is successful.

#### `onFormError` : `(response: object)`

A function callback that will be called when a submisison is unsuccessful.

#### `onFormLoad` : `(form: object)`

A function callback that will be called with a form is finished loading.

#### `onSubmissionLoad` : `(submission: object)`
