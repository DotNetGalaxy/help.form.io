In order to embed your **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** project in your angular application, you will need to add the formio module. The formio module will create all scopes, providers and directives needed to embed **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** components within your app.

#### Bower

To add `formio` to your bower dependencies, run `bower install --save ng-formio`.

#### Adding the dependencies

Formio requires some dependencies on your HTML page to work properly. All of these dependencies can be found by looking at the [**formio** bower.json](https://github.com/formio/ngFormio/blob/develop/bower.json#L25) file. The easiest way to include all of these dependencies within your webpage is to use a tool called [Wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep).

#### Wiredep

First you need to install wiredep.

```
  npm install -g wiredep
```

Next, add the following to your HTML page:

```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <!-- bower:css -->
      <!-- endbower -->
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- bower:js -->
      <!-- endbower -->
    </body>
  </html>
```

Next, run the following command to wire up all the dependencies.

```
  wiredep -s index.html
```

This should then wire all the dependencies into your page.

#### Example Page

To see this in action, [here is an example page](https://github.com/formio/examples.form.io/blob/master/simpleform/index.html) with all the dependencies already wired up for reference.

#### Initialize Angular

The next step is to initialize **formio** within your Angular application. This requires you to add the following to your angular.js declaration.

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['formio']);
```

And of course, if you are not using Angular for your full application, you will need to make sure that the application name is provided on the `<body>` tag.

```html
<body ng-app="myApp">

</body>
```
