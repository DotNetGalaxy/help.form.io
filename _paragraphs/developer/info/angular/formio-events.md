The formio module emits events at various times. These events are designed to allow developers to respond to events that occur within the formio generated forms. For example, after a user creates a new submission, you may want to change the view to display that submission or send them to a thank you page. You can do this by responding to the `formSubmission` event:

```html
$scope.$on('formSubmission', function(err, submission) { /* ... */ })
```


The following are all the events emitted by the above directives:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt><code>formSubmit</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Called after a form is submitted, but before it has been sent to the server. This submission can be cancelled by calling `event.preventDefault()`.
        <h5>Parameters:</h5>
        <code>submission</code>: The submission that was submitted.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>formSubmission</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Called after a form is successfully submitted to the server. This can be either a create or an edit.
        <h5>Parameters:</h5>
        <code>submission</code>: The submission that was submitted.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>formError</code></dt>

        Called whenever client side validation fails.
        <h5>Parameters:</h5>
        <code>error</code>: The error that occurred.
    </dd>

    <dt><code>formLoad</code></dt>
    <dd>
        Called whenever a form is loaded from the form.io server. This is useful to customize forms before they are displayed.
