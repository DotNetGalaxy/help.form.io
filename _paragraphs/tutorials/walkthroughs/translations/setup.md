Since the translations of Form.io elements are handled by the library itself, the implementation can be shown via pure javascript.
Below is as an example of a bare-bones use of our [core render](https://github.com/formio/formio.js) that we'll be adding
code to throughout the walk through.  

<div id="step1">
  <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/Formio/83tkkzLc/embed/result,js,html,css/"></script>
</div>
