Formio.js uses i18n, a lightweight translation module, which allow users to pass in a translation option during form construction. This gives users direct control over several form settings such as: 

 - Setting a forms default language
 - Changing the Forms default error messages
 - Defining a form default language behaviour 
 - Translating custom form message that were defined in a forms JSON definition

The guide that follows illustrates how to leverage this module in any application, regardless of framework preference.
