We assume in this that you already have a MongoDB instance available. We recommend services provided by [MongoDB Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) or [Compose](https://compose.com/) which integrates into AWS cloud. A Redis server can be provided by AWS ElasticCache service or through **Compose**.
