On-Premise Environments is supported with two different technologies, Docker and Node.js. We recommend using Docker over Node.js as it provides a pre-built and fully tested runtime. When using Node.js it is up to your organization to ensure all the dependencies are installed and up to date.

Whether using Docker or Node, ensure that the installed version is 5.0.0 or later.
