From the ```Stage Settings``` panel you'll be able to rename, delete, or even protect a stage from modification.

Protected mode prevents the modification of any form or resource within that particular stage.
Protected stages have a shield icon anchored to the left of their stage name making them easy to identify outside
of the stage settings panel. Please Note, the **Live** stage cannot be deleted or renamed.
