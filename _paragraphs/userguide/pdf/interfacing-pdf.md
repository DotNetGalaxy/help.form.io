Whenever a component is placed, the traditional dialog menu will appear allowing for labeling and 
defining the component particulars. When finished, click ```Save```.

With a completed form (shown below) it is worth mentioning that the PDF and components added above are regular
form elements and can just as easily be converted back into a traditional form.

Calling attention to the ```display as``` select menu, switching from **PDF** to **Form** will reveal the standard 
platform interface for forms.

The ability to toggle between a **Form** and **PDF** interface so readily illustrates the power of the platform. 
When building applications, the JSON schema can be updated according by changing  **display: "pdf"** to  **display: "form"**
and visa versa, users can replicate the platforms functionality, allowing for both interfaces to connect to the same API endpoints seamlessly.
