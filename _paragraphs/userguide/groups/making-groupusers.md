GroupUsers are the link between each Group and User. Through the GroupAssignment action, each group and user is linked together to share permissions on designated resources. To link a user to a group, the user submitting the form, must have edit access to the group, that is to say they must have a role with `update_all`/`update_own` or be assigned with `write`/`admin` permissions through resource submission permissions.
