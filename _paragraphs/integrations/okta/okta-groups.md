Now that we have an application created, lets add some Groups that we will eventually associate with Form.io User Roles. Click on the **Users**
at the top of the page, and then select **Groups**, and then click on the **Add Group** button.

We can now add a new group to the Okta system that should reflect any Roles that I have created within Form.io. A general rule of thumb is that we should
create an Okta role for every role that we have within our Form.io project.

Now that we have some groups, you can assign people to those groups within your organization, but this part is pretty self explanatory.
