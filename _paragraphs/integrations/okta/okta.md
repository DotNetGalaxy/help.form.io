The fastest way to get started with trying out Okta is to start with a **Developer Account**, which creates a new account within their Developer Sandbox. This provides you a way to have all the features enabled for development purposes.

To create a new Developer account, go to https://developer.okta.com/signup/

Once you create a new Okta account, your first step will be to create a new application within the Okta interface. From
your main dashboard page, go to the **Applications** section, and then click on the **Add Application** button.

Within the application wizard, make sure to click on **Web** button to create a new web application, and then click **Next**

Next click on the "Create New App" button.

In the next page, you will want to provide a title for your application, provide the **Base URIs** and then set the **Login redirect URIs** to the URL of your hosted application.
