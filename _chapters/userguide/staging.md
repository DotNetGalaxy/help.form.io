Staging and Form Visioning can provide enhanced versatility when it comes to managing form deployments. 
By allowing for up to 10 different stages per project, users can now replicate a dev, stage, prod like workflow 
from within the Form.io platform itself.
 
Staging and Form Versioning Features are limited to projects with **Team Pro** and **Enterprise** level plans. 
If you do not have any projects with Team Pro or Enterprise level projects, you can still experience the full breath of
Staging and Form Versioning from withing any **Trial** account.
