The [{{ site.formio }} Command Line Interface](https://github.com/formio/formio-cli) is a great way to get the most out of the {{ site.formio }} tool. There are a number of different commands that help you interact with the service, migrate data, as well as deploy projects from one environment to another.

To get started, simply type the following within your terminal.

```
npm install -g formio-cli
```

You can now see what commands are available by typing the following.

```
formio --help
```

These commands are available.
