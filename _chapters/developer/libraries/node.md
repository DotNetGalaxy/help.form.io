[Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

{{ site.formio }} was built on top of this amazing platform, so it is only natural we have a number of libraries that support it.
