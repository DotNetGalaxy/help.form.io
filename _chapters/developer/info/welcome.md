<p>While {% include formio.html %} provides an easy to use form builder and embeddable interface directly into your applications, sometimes it is necessary to be able to access the API directly. {% include formio.html %} will automatically build out your Rest API for you as you build your form and you are able to perform normal Restful requests directly to the API if you want. Because of how {% include formio.html %} is built, you can log in with your {% include formio.html %} account and get access to all the resources in your project. We do not recommend this for client facing applications though as you could expose your credentials to them. You can set up a User Resource inside your project to authenticate against to allow your users to use their own credentials and have access to restricted resources.</p>
<p>For a complete walkthrough on how to build an application using Form.io, we recommend watching the following video.</p>
